# Add the environment variables

## Fow Windows

Creating a new global system variable is quite simple and is one of those features hiding in plain sight. Please note the screenshots are for Windows Server 2008, however the process for most versions of Windows is almost identical with only a few of the screens different.

In the Control Panel, open the System option (alternately, you can right-click on My Computer and select Properties). Select the “Advanced system settings” link.

You can now access your new system environment variable like you would any other. You can use it from the command line or batch scripts without having to define it.

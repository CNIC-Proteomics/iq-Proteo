
Anselmo v0.04 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular Proteomics
Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used to identify
the integration which holds the median variance from a set of randomised
SanXoT integrations (i.e., integrations performed using SanXoT's parametre -R).

Anselmo needs at least:

1) the prefix (by using the -f argument) of the set of experiments, i.e. when
the info files of the randomisations are such as:

    heartExperiment1_infoFile.txt
    heartExperiment2_infoFile.txt
    ...
    heartExperimentZ_infoFile.txt

the prefix is considered to be "heartExperiment".

2) the folder where all those info files are (they must be in the same folder),
using the -p argument.

After reading the variances in the set of info files, Anselmo identifies the
info file containing the median of the set of variances, and then it renames
the files using its prefix, i.e. using the previous example, and assuming the
median of the variance is in experiment labelled "9", then it copies the files

    heartExperiment9_infoFile.txt
    heartExperiment9_higherLevel.txt
    heartExperiment9_outStats.txt
    ...

into

    med_heartExperiment_infoFile.txt
    med_heartExperiment_higherLevel.txt
    med_heartExperiment_outStats.txt
    ...

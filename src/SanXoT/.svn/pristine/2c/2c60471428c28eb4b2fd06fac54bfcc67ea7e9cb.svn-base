
MaesePedro v0.03 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular
Proteomics Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used to
generate pseudoinverted FASTA files.

Sanson needs one input files:

     * a FASTA file (using the -f command)

And delivers two output files:

     * the inverted FASTA file
     * a log file (default suffix: "_logFile")

Usage: maesepedro.py -f[FASTAFile]

   -h, --help          Display this help and exit.
   -a, --analysis=string
                       Use a prefix for the output files.
   -p, --place, --folder=foldername
                       To use a different common folder for the output files.
                       If this is not provided, the the folder used will be the
                       same as the FASTA file folder.
   -c, --cleavesites=string
                       The residues after which the protease is cleaving.
                       Default is trypsin (KR). Note that only C-terminal
                       cleaving proteases are being considered in this version.
   -f, --fastafile=string
                       The input FASTA file to invert.
   -r, --removepalindromes
                       Remove peptides unchanged upon pseudoinversion, i.e.,
                       peptides such as ASSAK, EGTGER (when using trypsin).
                       Palindromic peptides are not removed by default.
